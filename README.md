# Study of binary operations

In this repository, two scripts can be found: binary calculator and binary converter. Binary converter manually transforms decimals to binary and vice versa. Meanwhie, binary calculator does this with the help of existing in python functions, but is able to do operations with multiple-steps expressions, even combining logic and arithmetic operations on binary numbers. 

Arithmetic calculations go higher in order than logic ones in here, but NOT operation goes before all. All other operations go in the standard order of precedence.
