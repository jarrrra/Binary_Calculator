# Study of binary operations

In this repository, two files can be found: binary calculator and binary converter. The main file is the one that has the same name as the folder.

Binary converter manually transforms decimals to binary and vice versa. Meanwhile binary calculator does this with the help of existing in python functions, but is able to do operations with multiple-steps expressions, even combining logic and arithmetic operations on binary numbers. 

Arithmetic calculations go higher in order than logic ones in here, but NOT operation goes before all. All other operations go in the standard order of precedence.
